# Flask Template

version 0.0.1 (alpha)

## Development

**Install dependencies**

- Python 3.7.2 was tested
- Postgresql 10.3 was tested

1. Delete `peewee-db-evolve==3.7.0` from `requirements.txt` during the first installation.
   Because of how `peewee-db-evolve` created it's build process, we would first need to delete it.
1. Run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
1. Now add `peewee-db-evolve==3.7.0` back into `requirements.txt`
1. Run again:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

If you're having trouble installing dependencies

- Remove `certifi==2018.11.29` from requirements.txt

If you're having trouble starting flask

- Restart your terminal as well and reactivate conda source

## Starting Server

```
flask run
```

## Starting Shell
